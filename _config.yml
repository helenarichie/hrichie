user_description: <p style="text-align:left;">I am a second-year PhD student in the University of Pittsburgh's Department of Physics & Astronomy. I am interested in computational astrophysics, high-performance computing, and their applications to questions in galaxy evolution. Currently, I am working with Professor Evan Schneider on applying her hydrodynamics code, Cholla, to study dust evolution in disk galaxies.</p><p style="text-align:left;">I earned my B.Sc. in Physics & Astronomy and Mathematics from the University of Pittsburgh in 2020. During my undergrad I acted as Lead Undergraduate of the Survey of Transiting Extrasolar Planets at the University of Pittsburgh (STEPUP), an observational astronomy group that uses instruments based out of Pittsburgh's <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~aobsvtry/" style="color:#5C85D6">Allegheny Observatory</a> to detect transiting exoplanets.</p>
